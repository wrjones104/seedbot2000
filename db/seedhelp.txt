**Seed Creation Commands**
--------------------------------------------

**!rando** - rolls a seed with light randomization. Perfect for quick pick-up-and-go runs.
**!chaos** - if you like your flagsets to be a little more wacky, this one's for you! Much more liberal randomization can lead to some really interesting settings.
**!true_chaos** - this one randomizes... literally everything... with no weighting whatsoever. Test your FF6WC skill and knowledge... and your patience!
**!rollseed <flagset>** - rolls a seed from the specified flagset
**!devseed <flagset>** - rolls your seed using a dev version of the randomizer (use **!devhelp** for more info)
**!preset <name>** - rolls a seed from a user-preset flagset (use **!presethelp** for more info)

--------------------------------------------
**Additional Arguments (separate multiple arguments with spaces)**
--------------------------------------------

**&poverty** - all enemies have NOTHING!
**&steve** - everything is and always will be STEVE - you can add your own word after `&steve` to customize your fun!
**&paint** - randomize the sprites, portraits and palettes
**&palette** - randomize the palettes, keep the vanilla sprites & portraits
**&kupo** - moogles day out!
**&dev** - rolls your seed using a dev version of the randomizer (useful for appending to presets - use **!devhelp** for more info)
**&tunes** - randomizes the music with music from other games
**&ctunes** - randomizes the music chaotically, meaning that there's less chance the music type will match the area type where it appears
**&notunes** - removes all music, but leaves sound effects
**&obj** - replaces Objective A with 5/8 random objectives to unlock Final Kefka, and adds 4 additional random objective/reward sets
**&nospoiler** - ensures that no spoiler log will be included in the seed
**&noflashes** - forces the "Remove Worst Flashes" flag

**&doors** - randomizes entrances and exits in some areas
**&dungeoncrawl** - randomizes entrances and exits in some areas into one massive dungeon
**&local** - rolls the seed on SeedBot's local instance of WC instead of on the website
**&ap** - generates an Archipelago YAML of flagset instead of rolling a seed - you can add the additional text `on` after this argument to turn on the `treasuresanity` option when creating the YAML
**&flagsonly** - prints the flagset for your seed instead of rolling it
