# SeedBot2000

> SeedBot2000 is a friendly front-end for the Final Fantasy VI: Worlds Collide randomizer. It consists of a unified system with three main components: a Django web app for managing game presets, a Discord bot for rolling seeds, and a Celery worker for background tasks[cite: 1]. [cite_start]All components share a single SQLite database.

## Important Notes

* This project is an interface for a specific game randomizer, **Final Fantasy VI: Worlds Collide**, and its logic is tightly coupled to that system.
* The project is a **monolith** where the Django web app, Discord bot, and Celery worker all run from the same codebase and share the same database and settings.
* The production environment uses **Apache**, **mod_wsgi**, and **systemd** on a Linux server.
